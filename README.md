# <Week1 Challenge Assignement Solution  >

## Description

This project is the first version of My Profile.The objective was to create the basic framework for the profile website.
-I have tried my best to implement the code using the HTML/CSS skills and knowledge that I gained in the first and second week.
-I have tried to implement the functionalities as similar as given in the demo portfolio.
-I am happy that I was able to actually apply the skills, it gave me more clarity and confidence about the knowledge.



## Installation

-A public link has been created for the website which requires any web browser.


## Usage

The code renders to a webpage for my profile with a basic framework which will  keep updating as the course and work project progresses.
-The text links in the navigation bar in the header  are links to the referenced content section on the bottom section of the page.
-The middle section is the main content of the page describing the services.
-Middle content refers to About,Work and Contact.
-About section currently holds little bit information about me.(**will be updated)
-Work section just contains images in rows and columns.(**will be updated)
-Contact section has phone number,email ,links to github.Functionality for phone number and email has been implemented.

-Also the functionality for screen width has already been implemented.
-minimizing the screen ,minimizes the content in a readable format.
